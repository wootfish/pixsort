# pixsort
pixsort is a workspace repo for my experiments with pixel-sorting code.

Most of these scripts work. Some of them are broken. There's a lot of code duplication. Some of them include bugfixes which I discovered and then didn't propagate back earlier scripts.

This is because so far all my time and attention on this project has been devoted to mocking up new ideas and seeing what works.

My current goal is to build a frontend that not only simplifies using and compositing these effects but also allows them to be integrated together into one working script. This frontend is, naturally enough, called frontend.py, and it will never (intentionally) be broken in a commit.

My apologies for the current state of the code; I'd be more than happy to help troubleshoot any issues.
