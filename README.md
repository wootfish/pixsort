# pixsort
pixsort is a workspace repo for my experiments with pixel-sorting code.

frontend.py is a script which provides a GUI interface to various pixel sorts. It is currently very much a work in progress, and only provides minimal functionality as of yet.

Within the "oldstuff" directory are various proof-of-concept scripts, containing much inconsistency, redundancy, etc, but which currently allow a greater degree of flexibility.

The idea of frontend.py is to eventually bring all the ideas explored there & more together under one roof, and to simplify things like experimenting with parameter tweaks or composing sorts.

Note that there is no shortage of bugs and broken things in the oldstuff/* scripts.
