# pixsort
pixsort is a workspace repo for my experiments with pixel-sorting code.

frontend.py is a script which provides a visual interface for applying pixel sort effects to images. All new development is taking place on this script, and it is slowly but steadily growing more and more capable.

Within the "oldstuff" directory are various proof-of-concept scripts. These are very hacky and slapped-together. Some are broken entirely. They were where this project started and are now just included for reference as their functionality slowly gets folded into the frontend.py interface.

In addition to the standard packages, frontend.py reuqires the SciPy and Pillow libraries. It also depends on tkinter, which usually (but not always, to the best of my understanding) comes pre-installed with Python.
